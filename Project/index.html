        <p>

            Chris is a veteran of the 82nd Airborne Division, an attorney, and the CEO and founder of Legal GPS, an online, automated platform that helps businesses successfully take their first legal steps.
        
            </p>
            
        <p>
            Chris started his professional career by serving four years in active duty as a legal specialist and paratrooper for the U.S. Army in the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and finished as the top graduate in his legal training class. He deployed for one year to the province of Khost in Afghanistan, where he spent about 5% of his time doing cool stuff and the rest investigating foreign claims and advising commanders how to handle legal problems within their units. He later drew on his Afghanistan experience in his one of his publications, “When In Rome: Analyzing the Local Law and Custom Provision of the Foreign Claims Act,” which was published in 2012 in the Washington University Journal of Law and Policy.

            Following the Army, Chris finished his undergraduate degree summa cum laude at DePaul University, with a B.A. in History, where he played Rugby as DePaul’s scrum half and worked at DePaul’s writing center.

            Chris moved back to his roots of Saint Louis for law school and graduated cum laude from Washington University in St. Louis. During that time he clerked for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Saint Louis and the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington D.C. while in law school. He later went back to Wash U for night school to get his Masters of Law in Tax.
           
            </p>
        <p>
            After law school, Chris worked as an attorney for a local law firm well known for professional liability defense. Chris polished his litigation skills and after a few years decided to strike out on his own, forming a law firm focused on working with entrepreneurs. After working in a coworking space and seeing how coworking entrepreneurs were solving (or not solving) their legal problems, Chris realized the need for a product like Legal GPS and, after talking to dozens of entrepreneurs to find out what type of solution they would want, decided to devote himself full-time to creating Legal GPS.
